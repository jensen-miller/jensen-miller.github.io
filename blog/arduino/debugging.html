                            <h2>Using Serial</h2>
                            <p>This is the most common way to debug on Arduino... and also the most frustrating in the beginning. Here are some problems
                            I've encountered, and the best solution that I have found.</p>
                            <hr />
                            <h3>Problem 1: Cross-platform development</h3>
                            <p>When you develop libraries for multiple platforms (i.e. Raspberry Pi Linux, Windows IoT, etc.) you don't want to be switching
                            macros everywhere with <code>Serial.println()</code>. That is extremely tideous and painful, and not really "cross-
                            platform". On top of that, everywhere you want to error check, you now have to put a statement for each platform that respectively
                            does printing.
<pre><code>#ifdef ARDUINO
Serial.println("Error!");
#elif LINUX
... other printers ...
#endif</code></pre>
                            </p>
                            <h3>Solution 1: Cross-platform statements defined in library</h3>
                            <p>So then I decided it would be a great idea to make a debugger class a part of the library that would capture
                            the different methods by which a platform could print. But this of course meant each platform had to have it's own
                            implementation of the logger class. <code>Logger::WriteLine()</code></p>
                            <pre><code>
class Logger
{
public:
    static void WriteLine(const char* format, ...);
}</code></pre>
                            <p>Now each platform would just implement <code>WriteLine</code> and you could then call the method anywhere in code.
                            <h3>Problem 2: Smoothest?</h3>
                            <p>Uh, no. I didn't want to ship a library with a logger in it. Sure you could use a .gitignore, but then the
                            library won't compile where it is dependent on <code>Logger::WriteLine()</code> in a deliverable. So I needed a method that was well established
                            and already cross-platform.</p>
                            <h3>Solution 2: Isn't there printf?</h3>
                            <p>Well, yes, but not for Arduino. At the time, the only way to use <code>printf</code> on Arduino was if you had the Azure-C-SDK.
                            Since I wanted the only dependency to be the C99 library, I avoided using printf for some time. Being a naive coder at the time,
                            I hadn't realized GCC libc exported the method. For those that don't know, inside of your local Arduino15/ directory, you have the
                            GCC compiler, 4.8.3-2014q1 as of writing this. See more on <a href="#">Compilers and IoT</a>. Packaged with the GCC compiler,
                            is the C library, libc. libc carries all dependencies for C99, however <b>not all methods are implemented</b>.</p>
                            <p>Inside libc include/stdio.h ...</p>
                            <pre><code>int _EXFUN(printf, (const char *__restrict, ...)
    _ATTRIBUTE ((__format__ (__printf__, 1, 2))));</code></pre>
                            <p>So, just implement the method at the top of your sketch *.ino.</p>
                            <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;


int printf(const char* __restrict format, ...)
{
    char buf[300];
    va_list ap;
    va_start(ap, format);
    vsnprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), format, ap);
    Serial.write(buf);
    va_end(ap);
    Serial.println();
}


void __assert_func(const char* srcFileName, int srcFileLine, const char* fnName, const char* val)
{
    printf("!> Assertion Failed:\n>\tIn %s on line %d\n>\tIn %s\n>\tFailed on: %s", srcFileName, srcFileLine, fnName, val);
    abort();
}


void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
}


void loop() {

}
</code></pre>
                            <p>In addition to printf, I use a lot of assertions to prevent dumb mistakes. In Arduino, assert doesn't do anything other
                            than hang the device. So implementing assert in a way that provides us with an idea of where a failure occurs leveraging
                            printf is very helpful.</p>
                            <hr />
                            <p>These are just a couple of notes on Serial debugging that I hope will help, but they aren't perfect. For example,
                            you want to avoid using <code>printf()</code> in a interrupt service routine. Nevertheless, this is much more helpful than being limited
                            to <code>Serial.println()</code> in your sketch, or causing your library to become Arduino specific for a period. <b>Remember</b>
                            to initialize Serial in setup in order for the print statements to work. <b>Note</b> that because of this, you cannot use
                            <code>printf()</code> in constructors if the objects being constructed are static or at file scope. Construction would then
                            take place prior to setup, consequently before Serial is ready.</p>
